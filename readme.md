#John R. Emmons Personal Website

This is my static html homepage! I keep things
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) by using a shell
script in the ```templates``` directory to insert repeated sections of html
code. It is a simple idea, but it is a huge time saver when I need to make an 
update and helps me prevents errors.

##Usage: 
This repository is designed to be unpacked directly onto a static webserver. All
css and js dependencies should be
in[```Skeleton-2.0.4```](Skeleton-2.0.4).  Setting up the page should
be as simple as

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jremmons/johnemmons.com .
```

Warning: do no edit the files in the top-level directory of this
repository. These are autogenerated and will be overwritten. Instead, edit the
.html and .html.eb files in the [```templates```](templates) directory.

The [```blockInsert.sh```](templates/blockInsert.sh) script in the
[```templates```](templates) directory is the primary helper code. This script
scans for .html and html.eb files in its current directory. The contents of the
.html.eb embedded block files will be inserted into the .html files at locations
marked by blocks of the form ```<!-- <<<example.html.eb>>> -->```. Example
below.

```bash
# run the blockInsert code
./templates/blockInsert.sh 
```

```html
<!-- Contents of index.html -->>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

<!-- <<<example.html.eb>>> -->

</body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- Contents of example.html.eb -->>

<h1> My hiking blog <\h1>

<p>
  I enjoying hiking! Hiking is so much fun...
</p>
```

```html
<!-- Contents of index.html after running blockInsert.sh -->>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

<!-- <<<example.html.eb>>> -->
<h1> My hiking blog <\h1>
