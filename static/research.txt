Research problems in the physical and biological sciences are dramatically more
complex and larger in scale than they were a decade ago. Developing fast,
accurate, and scalable computational solutions to these problems is challenging,
making it difficult for scientists and engineers without a background in
large-scale computing to efficiently solve the computational problems they
encounter. Creating new systems and programming models that abstract the
complicated details necessary to achieve high performance on next generation
computing platforms is vital to continued advancement in research areas such as
biology, cosmology, machine learning, and physics. My goal is to create high
performance systems that empower domain scientists with massive parallelization,
heterogeneous systems, and hybrid architectures.

In the long-term, I plan to continue performing research in computer systems as
a research/staff scientists in an academic or industrial environment. I am
currently looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my background
in high performance systems design in a research setting.
