<p> The 2014 ESE study abroad trip to Tel Aviv University (TAU) in Israel was an unforgettable experience to me. Tel Aviv University is an amazing school for learning and living. Academically speaking, I learned much during the visits to the various laboratories in TAU. In Professor Amir Ayali‘s and Dr. Yossi Yovel’s labs, we saw how biologist and zoologist analyze the movements of cockroaches and bats with control system and signal processing techniques. Meeting with the composer Isaac Mazor from the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music in the music lab, we tuned the harmonic sounds by using our understanding of Fourier transforms.<br>
  <br>
  In general, I feel the many academic activities at TAU are really interdisciplinary. On the other hand, the student life at TAU is interesting. During our experience at TAU’s Student Day, I met the energetic and diverse student body. Although the students have more than 25 hours of classes per week, many of them balance their study and social life pretty well. Talking with Israeli students who all have to enlist in the army before enrolling in college, I realized that we should treasure the peace we have, since it gives us the opportunity to focus on our studies while we are still young.<br>
  <br>
 At the same time, TAU has a very practical and career-orientated atmosphere. For example, when listening to the students in the Faculty of Engineering introducing their senior designs, I was impressed by the project that helps to retrieve the expensive GPS locators used to track birds by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority after the tracked birds have died. I feel that TAU students are actively involved in solving real life problems for multiple corporations and organizations. These relationships give the students financial support, allowing them more resources and the opportunity to do more hands-on works.<br>
  <br>
 I hope WashU students can also try to build up this kind of cooperation relationship with some corporations, because these real world projects will give students clearer ideas about what can they do with the things they learned in class. What’s more, during the visit, I also felt the students’ and faculties’ passions for entrepreneurship. People from the StarTAU, the entrepreneurship center of TAU, and many other organizations all told us that in Israel, a student can directly email a CEO of large corporation for advice and support, and this friendly social atmosphere greatly encourages the new stars in businesses.<br>
  <br>
  With this idea in mind, I really enjoyed the tours to those start-up companies. During the visit to SolarEdge, I learned much background information of how to turn knowledge, technology, and research into products and earn profits. We listened to the presentation given by Dr. David Mendlovis in Corephotonic, I learned how to convince potential consumers with fanatical benefits, protect company’s patents, and share risks with producers.<br>
  <br>
 Last but not least, I want to express my sincere appreciations to Mr. Charlie Simmons for sponsoring us a wonderful trip. We very much enjoyed the hotel, foods and etc. I can’t express how grateful I am for your generosity. Professor Arie Yeredor, thank you so much for taking good care of us at Tel Aviv University, and Professor Arye Nehorai, thank you for giving us the opportunity to travel. We are so lucky to have a nice and thoughtful department chair like you! </p>

<p> This recent trip to Israel was a great experience for me. Among the experiences I have had at WashU, this is definitely at the top. Having been born and raised within the Show Me State, in the small town of Waynesville, I had never had a chance to leave the United States. Without including the occasional road trip to visit relatives, I hardly even left Missouri. Therefore, going to another continent is quite a big step for me, but I knew it would be an incredible chance that I could not pass up. Not only would I be able to visit Jerusalem, which has a fascinating history, I would also be able to learn more about the engineering field in Israel, and perhaps make some friends along the way.<br>
  <br>
  To be honest, I had no idea what to expect once I got there. I do not think I had ever heard Hebrew prior to this trip nor had I a single inkling of the dos and don’ts of Israeli culture. Even with my lack of exposure or perhaps because of it, I learned quite a lot during the week. One aspect of this trip that really was a pleasant surprise was the kind and attentive attitudes of everyone we met; they were more than willing to answer questions, even those whose answers might have seemed obvious to them. Through these interactions, I was able to discover some interesting differences in culture—one example would be that it is much easier and in fact encouraged for aspiring entrepreneurs to reach out to successful CEOs of companies and ask for advice; it’s not considered rude nor pretentious as it would be in the United States. Nonetheless, my learning was not just limited to culture differences; along the way, I gained motivation for learning in the classroom.<br>
  <br>
  Including the city tours, I got to see various research labs of Tel Aviv University and a few companies as well. Seeing the different applications of concepts I’ve learned throughout these presentations has allowed me to have a new perspective of class material. Getting caught up in schoolwork can sometimes decrease my desire to learn, but hearing speakers from diverse fields has fostered a new appreciation for increasing my knowledge that I had just about forgotten. They have reminded me of the importance of truly mastering material. For instance, when we visited SolarEdge, a solar power optimization company, some problems were explained that I had not even known existed. Although some phrases were familiar, I had not really taken the time to explore or think about issues associated with the industry. In fact, I realized that I hardly take the time to see connections between real world issues and what I learn in my classes; I’m normally concerned with turning in my homework on time. Through hearing the numerous presentations, my curiosity for such understanding has been renewed.<br>
  <br>
 With this newfound inspiration comes a feeling of gratitude towards those who made this opportunity possible.  I would first like to thank Dr. Arye Nehorai, the ESE Chair and founder of this program, who first extended this invitation and helped put together the itinerary. Although I had been nervous about going abroad and had many concerns, he very graciously answered any questions that I had and made me feel at ease.<br>
  <br>
  
 I would like to show my gratitude to Professor Arie Yeredor, who also not only helped plan the trip but guided us around Tel Aviv University. As soon as we met, he instantly ensured we felt welcome and comfortable, and it was always a joy to see him. Our constant companion, Elad Gilboa, also deserves a thank you. I am very grateful for his willingness to answer questions, ability to include everyone, and of course, his aid in translating our food orders. Finally, I thank Mr. Charlie Simmons, who generously donated funds towards this program. Without his support, this wonderful opportunity may have passed by.<br>
  <br>
 It has been somewhat difficult to express in words how much this trip has meant to me. I never once thought that I would be able to visit Israel, at least not this soon. Once again, I would like to thank everyone whose efforts led to making this rare occasion possible. </p>

<p> The Electrical and Systems Engineering Department’s 2014 trip to Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel was an invaluable experience for me. The opportunity to spend over a week in Israel exposed me to ideas, history, and culture in some ways that I expected but also in some that I had never imagined. Most importantly, the time we spent in Israel helped me to broaden my perspective as a world citizen and as an electrical engineer.<br>
  <br>
  Being my first time traveling outside the United States, the visit to Israel was filled with new experiences. The ability to spend time in another culture and to really be immersed in it was very unique, and I don’t think it is an experience I will forget anytime soon. The aspect of culture in Israel that made the biggest impression on me was the different attitude Israeli students had toward school. Since almost everyone in Israel spends the first few years after their high school graduation serving in the military, the students are typically older by the time they start their undergraduate degree. This means that many of them have a number of responsibilities beyond their education and, as a result, have a much more professional attitude towards schoolwork. In addition to giving me an interesting perspective as I continue my studies, I think this knowledge will help me to be more aware of how the life experience of people in other parts of the world differs from my own.<br>
  <br>
  As a world citizen, the trip to Tel Aviv helped to broaden my perspective on world events by giving me useful insight on Israel as a country and on its relation to other world powers. During our tours of Tel Aviv, Yafo, and Jerusalem, we had the opportunity to see much of the cities and to learn much about the history of the cities and the history of Israel in general. The widely varying landscapes, architecture, beliefs, and lifestyles that we saw on the tours helped to showcase Israel’s diversity and give a new perspective on Israel itself. Similarly, the history that we learned on the tours helped to provide context for many recent world events in the Middle East involving Israel, and will, hopefully, continue to help me understand world events in the region and Israel’s place in them.<br>
  <br>
 The opportunity to spend a week in a part of the world famous for being a hub of research and innovation in the technology industry was also a valuable experience academically and professionally speaking. More specifically, our visits to the labs at Tel Aviv University and the companies throughout the city gave me an improved sense of what topics are available on the cutting edge of electrical engineering research and industry and a taste of the start-up culture that has formed in Israel.<br>
  <br>
  The labs that we visited were studying a wide variety of topics. There were labs studying some of the usual topics in electrical engineering, such as semiconductor manufacturing and signal processing, but also some labs that were studying electrical engineering topics as they relate to some seemingly unrelated topics. For instance, there was one lab that studies the response of locusts to visual stimuli to quantify how a locust could be controlled for some application such as surveillance.<br>
  <br>
 On the other hand, the visits to the start-up companies in the Tel Aviv area helped to give me an idea of how companies are using the most recent research to solve problems and how they are monetizing these ideas. At the very least, these visits have given me some interesting ideas for my senior design projects, and I think that these experiences will also help me make some important choices as I begin my career.<br>
  <br>
 Finally, I would like to thank all the people that helped to make this trip possible. Specifically, I would like to thank Mr. Charles Simmons for his generous donation towards our travel expenses; Dr. Nehorai for his work in planning the trip; Prof. Arie Yeredor of Tel Aviv University for helping to coordinate the activities of the trip and for being such a gracious host; Elad Gilboa for accompanying us on the trip; and the students of Tel Aviv University for their company during our stay in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p> The eight-day trip I just undertook  to Israel was easily one the most profound and memorable experiences of my life so far. The interactions I had in numerous labs at Tel Aviv University, adventures throughout Tel Aviv and other regions of Israel, and insights I received from various Israeli Entrepreneurs has altered the way I view both the field of Engineering and my future career ambitions.<br>
  <br>
  I was extremely impressed with the work being undertaken throughout the campus of TAU (Tel Aviv University). Over the course of a week, I was able to listen to presentations from over a dozen different researchers who specialize in fields ranging from Nonlinear Optics to Zoological Processes Applications. It was eye opening to see some of the different approaches these men and women were taking to solve some very difficult Engineering problems.<br>
  <br>
  A second byproduct of this trip was a significant appreciation I gained for a number of areas across Israel. Tel Aviv is one of the most attractive cities I have ever been to; I loved walking along the miles of Mediterranean coastline that served as the city’s Western border. Jaffa was another beautiful section of the city, with cobblestone streets and buildings that are thousands of years old. Moving away from central Israel, visiting the city of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea was probably the highlight of my trip, as I got to tour many of the most profound landmarks of the Jewish, Islam, and Christian faiths. The Dead Sea, while not as historically as significant as the Old Quarters of Jerusalem, was an absolute blast to swim in, and well worth the afternoon excursion.<br>
  <br>
 Lastly, touring multiple Israeli startups and learning about the cultural emphasis the country of Israel places on Entrepreneurialism is something I found to be incredibly valuable. In addition to Systems Engineering, I am also majoring in Entrepreneurship in the Business School at WashU. The products we sampled at Core Photonics, Visonic, and Solar Edge (3 Israeli start ups) served as fine examples of how the fields of Engineering and Entrepreneurship can work together to benefit people across the globe. Seeing the excitement held by Entrepreneurs in Tel Aviv reconfirmed my love of Entrepreneurship, and leaves me eager to see what changes I can bring about after my time in college.<br>
  <br>
  The time that we spent touring the sites around Israel will be an unforgettable experience.  Some of the sites we visited are places I have been hearing about from family and friends for my entire life.  It was edifying to see Israeli customs and culture firsthand since I had always held certain notions from what I had heard from others. In particular, it was very meaningful to walk around the old city of Jerusalem. Standing before the Western Wall was an awing experience and one which I will always carry with me.<br>
  <br>
I cannot begin to thank Professor Nehorai and Tel Aviv University enough for preparing this trip and to our sponsor, Mr. Simmons, for making this trip possible. To all Engineers considering taking this trip in the future- do it! It is an opportunity I can’t recommend enough! </p>

<p> The trip to Tel Aviv sponsored by the ESE Department was a fantastic experience and one that I will never forget. It was a great opportunity and reminder of the incredible things possible by becoming an electrical engineer and to experience the culture and history of Israel. I am grateful to all those at Washington University and Mr. Simmons for making this trip possible. For those in Israel that served as our hosts, guides and shared their experiences as students I am appreciative of their willingness to give their time and knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  We observed areas of research different than at WashU including some not conventionally thought of as having electrical engineering applications. One of my favorites was a lab studying insects. Their investigation of locusts’ swarming activity especially interested me with potential applications to systems engineering and operations research.  Another lab investigates the use of fiber optics as sensors. One sensor can detect underground tunneling activity; upon hearing this, I immediately saw the potential for use in policing techniques in detecting tunnel construction along the U.S. southwestern border. Prior to this trip, I was firmly rooted in my Systems engineering major, but seeing the incredible applications of electrical engineering inspired me to expand my education to include a second major in applied science electrical engineering (at least).<br>
  <br>
  Another facet of our trip explored the start-up culture in Israel. We visited two companies founded within the last decade and heard several discussions about start-ups and programs at Tel Aviv University to assist interested students and faculty. Of those visited, SolarEdge was my favorite. The CEO met with us to discuss the solar energy industry, as well as what SolarEdge did as a company. It was amazing to see how a company founded in 2007 with a good idea now tops $200 million in sales while becoming an industry leader. The Israeli start-up culture is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the importance of practical applications research.<br>
  <br>
 Our trip to and tour of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea were also a great part of the journey. The mingling of three major religions in such a holy place was incredible to experience. Walking among ancient monuments and attempting to grasp the cultural and historical significance to not only Israel but the world was awe-inspiring. Our guide was very knowledgeable, we had a great place to stay and tons of fun as well as learning about Jerusalem with a side trip to the Dead Sea.<br>
  <br>
  I loved getting to know some of the Israeli students and hearing about their undergraduate experiences at TAU. I did not know how Israel’s mandatory military service was implemented prior to the trip. I was surprised to learn they serve first, then pursue their undergraduate education. The students we met were excited about their education, university and work as well as being great ambassadors. Tel Aviv University is much larger than WashU and I was able to observe laboratory work and equipment in larger laboratories with expanded equipment.<br>
  <br>
  The trip to Israel was one of the best experiences of my time at WashU and of my life. This was my second international trip and first to the Middle East. I had the opportunity to visit two new countries (I stayed on and visited Jordan), experience cultures very different than our own and meet classmates from WashU that I did not know. There has to be a tremendous amount of work involved in the planning and funding of such a trip. I feel privileged to be one of the beneficiaries of those that made this trip and once in a lifetime opportunity possible. It is rare to combine education, fun, culture, business and history in one trip, but mission accomplished! </p>

<p> The trip to Israel with Electrical and Systems Department was an invaluable experience to me both intellectually and socially.<br> 
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv University, we were exposed to research labs in different fields, including Signal Processing labs, Nonlinear Optics labs, Zoological Department and even the Computer Class & Recording Studio in the Music Department. It is simply impressive to see how things in different areas come together eventually to create interesting problems.<br>
  <br>
  Outside of Tel Aviv University, the trip was organized in such a fascinating way that we got the chance to see both the modern and the traditional parts of Israel. Tel Aviv is such an exciting and vibrant city to live in and it represents the modern look of Israel. For me, one of the most awesome parts of the trip is to visit some of the local start-ups in Tel Aviv and get a flavor of Israeli entrepreneurial environment. Corephotonics, a small start-up designing dual-lens smartphone camera, was actually founded by Prof. David Mendlovic from Tel Aviv University. I found it especially intriguing to learn how the university is closely related to industry and how the academia result is successfully commercialized and make a difference in the world. It is quite interesting that the company WashU group visited two year ago, PrimeSense, has got too big and got acquired by Apple. Israel really deserves the name ‘The nation of start-ups’.<br>
  <br>
  The other amazing part of the trip is the opportunity to experience the culture and history of Israel (and I really missed the Mid-eastern food Falafel and shawarma!). During the two-day tour, we visited some of the coolest parts on the planet: the old city of Yafo, Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. I was so thrilled to get the firsthand experience of places I had only read on books and the city of Jerusalem was breathtaking beautiful.<br>
  <br>
 It was inspiring to learn about different cultures and see how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim people live together in this holy city. During the second day of the trip I had great fun floating on the Dead Sea for the first time and now I could cross one thing off from my bucket list!<br>
  <br>
  Finally, I would like to thank our generous donor, Mr. Charlie Simmons (BSEE, 1970), for sponsoring this wonderful experience for students in Electrical and Systems Department. I would also like to thank the chair of our department, Prof. Arye Nehorai , and Prof. Arie Yeredor from Tel Aviv University to put together such a great itinerary together and I was truly impressed by the high quality of this study abroad trip. Last but least, I really appreciate the students in Tel Aviv university, Elad Gilboa , and the amazing group from WashU who accompanied me during the trip and made this experience incredibly fun and beyond my expectation. I am very grateful for being able to participate in this trip and thank you again to these people for giving us this once-in-a-lifetime experience. </p>

<p> I went on this trip to Tel-Aviv University hoping to be inspired and to have fun. Having recently joined the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, I believed that it was a great opportunity for me to see what choices are available for people with interest in electrical engineering. A country with a huge impact in technology and research like Israel was a great choice.  Tel-Aviv is a great place for  scientific research and its universities have played a great role and still remain significant in the field of research.<br> 
  <br>
  There is a great number of technology oriented startups that are coming up with great solutions and improvements to current technology. Our group had the opportunity to visit Corephotonics, among other companies, to receive a demonstration of their advanced camera technologies. It was great to see how much current technology can be improved. We had lab tours and presentations in Tel-Aviv University which were educational and exciting. All of these gave me a glimpse of what it is like to be an engineer.br>
  <br>
  When we were not learning about cool and ground-breaking researches, we were having a great time at Students’ Day Celebration at TAU, watching shows in theatres, visiting awesome historical sites and landmarks in Tel-Aviv, Jaffa and Jerusalem, swimming in the Dead Sea or enjoying the beautiful sunset by the Mediterranean Sea. I will never forget the amazing time I had in Tel-Aviv. This trip has been a wonderful experience and I am very glad to have taken a part in it.<br>
  <br>
  I would like to thank our donor Mr. Charlie Simmons, Professor Arye Nehorai, Professor Arie Yoredor and Elad Gilboa for making this study abroad program possible.</p>
