<p> The trip to Israel with the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering was a wonderful experience.  The ten days packed with research labs, engineering companies, and Israeli culture were great.<br>
  <br>
  It was very interesting to see all of the different research labs.  We saw labs from all over Tel Aviv University, not just from electrical or systems engineering.  It was fascinating to see how all of these different labs really come together and are all related.  It shows how important collaboration is between different fields.  I especially enjoyed the lab at the zoological research facility.  I remember a lot of us were wondering what the zoological laboratory had to do with engineering.  We had no idea that it could relate so much to our department.  Our speaker told us about his research on bat sonar and how he uses signal processing to study the ultrasonic pulses the bats produce.<br>
  <br>
  Besides the labs, it was really cool to visit some of the high-tech companies in the Tel Aviv area.  One of the highlights for me was going to Prime Sense.  They are the company who developed the technology for the Xbox Kinect.  It was really cool to see the work they are doing in 3D image processing.<br>
  <br>
  We also had the opportunity to participate on a weekend trip to Jerusalem.  I had been to Jerusalem before and it is one of my favorite places.  It was great to walk around in the narrow passageways between shops, hearing all sorts of languages being shouted around you.  Swimming in the Dead Sea was also an extremely fun experience.<br>
  <br>
  I would have to say my favorite aspect of the entire trip was meeting and befriending the Israeli students.  It was a great experience hanging out with them and hearing their stories.  It was fun getting to know them and see how similar we are, even having grown up half a world away.<br>
  <br>
I really appreciate having the opportunity to come on this trip.  Many thanks to the hosts and to the donor who made it possible.  It was a great experience overall and I am glad to have participated. </p>

<p> The recent trip that the ESE department took to Israel was a wonderful experience. While in Israel, I had the opportunity to learn more about possible career and research areas that I can pursue in the future through visits to some top High-Tech companies and to a variety of labs on the campus of Tel Aviv University. We were able to tour a wide variety of labs, everything from nanofabrication labs to a zoological garden, which demonstrates the wide variety of opportunities that engineering majors can explore. It was especially interesting visiting some of the companies that also have offices in the US to see the differences in the culture and how that is reflected in the work environment.<br>
  <br>
  This trip was also my first time out of the US so it was an exciting cultural experience. Our weekend trip included a tour of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Although we were staying in Tel Aviv, it was great to learn about these cities from a different perspective: a historical perspective. We also traveled to Jerusalem, Masada and the Dead Sea where we learned more about the history of Israel and the history of the area.  It was wonderful to see firsthand the places that I have read and learned about.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, I feel that some of the most valuable things that I took away from my trip to Israel were the relationships formed with the people that were on the trip with me, as well as with the people that I met in Israel. We were able to meet many students from Tel Aviv University and learn more about what life is like there from the student perspective. We learned about the students’ academic lives as well as how they spent their time outside of the classroom. It was interesting to compare our college experience with theirs. In addition, I was able to get to know the Wash U students on the trip with me, as I didn’t know many of them at all before the trip!<br>
  <br>
    This trip was a wonderful once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience and I truly appreciated the chance to learn about so many different aspects of engineering and Israeli life. The many opportunities available within the ESE department, such as this trip, are truly life changing experiences.  I am so thankful to be a part of the department and very grateful to Dr. Nehorai and Mr. Simmons who made this trip possible.</p>

<p> As a rising senior double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Finance and not really knowing what I wanted to do after I graduate, this trip was unbelievably helpful for me. Part of the reason why I was not sure what I wanted to do was because I didn’t really know what it was that engineers actually did. This trip exposes you to all of the different options and opportunities engineers have after college. You get to meet with several engineers that all have unique career paths which really does help you to see what is best for you or what is not best for you.<br>
  <br>
  Not only do you get to meet many engineers but you also get to see and learn about their current projects that they are working on which I thought was the coolest part of the trip and what got me the most excited and proud to call myself an engineer. The projects ranged from manipulating locust movement using electrical signals to hacking into people’s cell phone conversations (don’t worry this was shown to us by a highly regulated security software and hardware company). Seeing all of these different kinds of projects showed me that there are literally endless opportunities for engineers. One of the professors at TAU told us to ask ourselves a question as we left Israel, “If you had the chance to ask God one question which he had to give you the answer to, what would it be?” This question highlights a unique quality about engineers that I learned on this trip, we can create any problem or question that intrigues us and we have the ability using the skillset that we are taught to answer that question.<br>
  <br>
  This trip wasn’t just about engineering either. We got to go on a three day tour of some of the most interesting places on this planet. The first day we toured Tel Aviv and the old city of Jaffa. Then the second day we went to Jerusalem and the last day we visited Masada and the Dead Sea. We also got to meet a bunch of amazing Tel Aviv University students. They showed us around campus and the nightlife at Tel Aviv. I have had some of the most unforgettable experiences of my life during this trip and would highly recommend it to any engineering student as this trip will undoubtedly be helpful to all.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, this trip would not have been made possible if it wasn’t for the generosity of several people. Our donor, Mr. Charlie Simmons, made it possible for any student to go and not have to worry about finances. The people at Tel Aviv University were the most welcoming hosts and put together a great program for us. Elad Gilboa, the grad student that accompanied us, was not only unbelievably helpful in every aspect of the trip but also incredibly fun to hang out with. And last but not least, Prof. Nehorai was the one that put this all together and brought in all the pieces to make this trip what it was. He put together this trip purely for the students and it truly shows how much he cares for us by the quality of the trip as a whole. So once again thank you to these people for giving us this opportunity.</p>

<p> My recent trip to Israel was an invaluable experience as an individual, student, and engineer. I am extremely grateful for having had the opportunity to have been able to travel to such an amazing country.<br>
  <br>
  This trip exposed me to the many different possible opportunities that an undergraduate student can pursue after graduation. Visiting the incredible research labs of Tel Aviv University and the different businesses gave me insight into the different possible applications of engineering and the breadth of opportunities our education provides. I didn’t realize how important university research was for the society and the advancement of technology it brings, until this trip. For example, I found it especially intriguing to observe the labs where bio-mimcry efforts took nature’s efficiencies in bugs and translated them to possible innovative technologies.<br>
  <br>
  Being able to visit the monuments and immersing myself in the culture firsthand proved to be an amazing experience. A place of history and immense significance, it meant a lot to me that I was able to see with my own eyes. I was also especially impressed with how well everybody spoke English, and how amicable and friendly the local people were. My two favorite places visited were the Old City, where we were able to experience the convergence of so many cultures, and the Dead Sea, where we had a lot of fun floating!<br>
  <br>
  Finally, being able to go on this trip makes me feel closer to the ESE Department and thankful that I am part of such a great program. Traveling with nine other Wash U Engineering students and getting to know them better, throughout the ten days, was a lot of fun. I look forward to seeing the same faces back on campus in the Fall.<br>
  <br>
  Overall, I am ecstatic that I went on this trip for all the tangible and intangible lessons learned and experiences gained. I hope to revisit the country one day and explore more of this great country again. I would like to thank the donor, Mr. Charlie Simmons, Professor Nehorai, and the Tel Aviv University faculty and students, especially Professor Yeredor, for making this trip possible and so successful.</p>

<p>I am so grateful to have participated in our trip to Tel Aviv University. It is impossible to accurately articulate how profound the experience was for me. Personally, this trip was of particular significance because I would like to go to graduate school in Israel, and eventually join the workforce. The trip provided me with a platform for to ask questions, become acquainted with programs at TAU, and explore opportunities in the high-tech industry.<br>
  <br>
  The myriad of labs we visited demonstrated the breadth of the Electrical and Systems Engineering curriculum. For example, we visited the Zoological Gardens, where we observed researchers interacting with bats, studying the signal processing they use for echo location. I enjoyed our tour of the Aerodynamics lab and wind tunnels, as well as the DSP lab, where I was in awe of the senior projects that were presented.<br>
  <br>
  We had the privilege of visiting three companies: Motorola Solutions, Verint, and Prime Sense. It was incredible to see applications of Electrical and Systems Engineering in the high-tech industry. With our engineering foundation, I could follow the concepts of the technologies upon which these awesome companies were founded. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting these companies and gaining exposure to the industry.<br>
  <br>
  My favorite aspect of the trip was the mifgash between the WU and TAU students. It was fun to compare various aspects of student life at each university. One major difference was the amount of extra-curricular opportunities we participate in at WU. The nine of us have allegiances to various sororities, fraternities, sports teams, and honorary societies. Some of us have jobs, conduct research, and are getting degrees in concentrations outside of engineering. These extra-curriculums weren’t necessarily a part of student life at TAU. The Engineering department was centered on academics and research. Additionally, the department strongly discouraged students from even having a job in their first few semesters at school. However, there were some common denominators: nerdy jokes, senior projects, all-nighters, and Frisbee. We swapped traditions. WU brought Ultimate Frisbee to TAU, and we all spent our lunch breaks playing together on campus. We are bringing home some new vocab words and a reaffirmed love of falafel.<br>
  <br>
  I am very fond of the new friendships formed, with both WU and TAU students. I am extremely thankful to Dr. Nehorai, Dr. Yeredor, and our gracious hosts for coordinating such a meaningful trip, as well as to the donor for making this vision a reality.</p>

<p> The trip to Israel was a very rewarding experience. First, I would like to thank the University for organizing this opportunity, and the generous donor who made this trip possible for us. Honestly after I left my country 5 years ago to study in US I just haven’t had the time or extra money to travel abroad -- not even back home to Iran!<br>
  <br>
  As an Iranian I have a very different perspective from the trip than other students. Typically Iranians are not granted visas to travel freely to and from Israel. For me, being able to go to Israel was a dream come true and my family and friends at home just couldn’t believe it. Before the trip, I wasn’t sure how people were going to receive me because I am Iranian but to my surprise I received much more love and respect than I could have ever imagined.<br>
  <br>
  Our trip to the Tel Aviv University, one of the top technical schools in Israel, was incredible. At the Tel Aviv University we visited different labs, such as the Robotics Lab, Neuroscience Lab, Nonlinear Optics Lab, Nano-Technology Lab, Locust Lab and we learned about the research projects that were done by professors and students. I was truly impressed by their work. In addition, we visited many engineering companies such as PrimeSence, Motorola Solutions, Verint, and StarTau and learned about the engineering projects that were done by talented students for their senior design class. Student’s Day at Tel Aviv University was plenty fun.  We got to make friends and spend the night together talking, dancing and getting to know each other more.  Even though the students were older,  because of their military service, they accepted us warmly and we will continue to be friends. We got to know so many new people and made several connections for the future.<br>
  <br>
  I felt very lucky to be able to visit many significant historical and religious places and learn about Israel culture, food, geography and history. Our visit to Old Jaffa, Jerusalem and its different quarters, Mount of Olives, Masada, Western Wall, and Qumran was incredibly inspiring. We had opportunity to float in the Dead Sea and made good memories spending some evening and night by Mediterranean Sea playing. Food was great and we were fed so much of it. I truly missed eating delicious falafel, hummus, kabob and shawarma after I came back to US.<br>
  <br>
 I also had a trip to Haifa and I visited the Baha’i World Centre and holy places in Bahji and Akko. So many Baha’is around the world put their name in the waiting list to have opportunity to come to Haifa for pilgrimage. At the end of my trip I spent many hours praying for family and friends at Haifa.  I left holy land and beautiful Israel with inspiring memories, beautiful gifts, and unique pictures, and rewarding engineering experiences and knowledge.</p>

<p> As an Iranian student at Washington University in St. Louis, the Israel trip was an important and unique opportunity to explore Israeli history, technology, education, religions, and culture.  I am glad and fortunate to have the ability to experience Israel for myself, which not only completely disproved all my former ideas but also had a great impact on my life.<br>
  <br>
  A few days before the trip, I got my Bachelors of Science degree in electrical engineering and was not sure what my next step would be. My sister and I live on our own in the USA and financial issues and other responsibilities slow down our academic life. Comparing my personal issues with those of all younger students at Washington University made me insecure about attending graduate school. At Tel Aviv University, I met students who were closer to my age, as they had to serve in the military prior to enrolling in college. I was surprised how they could manage their education successfully up through the PHD level in addition to other personal responsibilities, including taking care of their family.<br>
  <br>
  During the trip we visited large companies such as Motorola Solutions and Verint. We also got to see the experiments and research that was performed at Tel Aviv University from Electronic lab to Robotic lab, Neuroscience, Nano-technology, Zoological researches as well as the senior year projects that were done in the university or within the companies. I liked how the students and faculty were hospitable and willing to share their projects with us. I had not thought about going beyond Washington University for sharing research and project ideas on work done in different countries. I networked with many members of the faculty and students in different research areas for my future reference. I was also very interested in learning of the international school in Tel Aviv University, which also made me consider going beyond the opportunities in the United States, like getting involved in international engineering organizations.<br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv University, students had the opportunity to freely pick the professor who they want to work with or chose the company and were allotted a year to complete their senior year projects. Doing projects or having job within industry, help them have advantages such as more hands on experiment, knowing their talents and desires in specific area, being less stressed about finding job or knowing what they want to do after graduation as well as having income and good connections for their future jobs.<br>
  <br>
   The social and cultural aspects of this trip were so amazing. We had a professional tour around Tel Aviv and different parts of Jerusalem. We visited and heard about holy places for Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths and we had our first experience floating in the Dead Sea and riding camels.<br>
  <br>
   This trip had an important impact on my personal and academic life. I grew confident about continuing my education beyond an undergraduate degree and came up with a good plan to explore my possibilities in graduate school.  I learned about the projects on tracking and robotics, and feel that I would like to further my education in these topics.  Visiting other labs and researches beyond electrical engineering at Tel Aviv University, helped to have general knowledge about those fields. I also started thinking of taking computer science courses in graduate school because I realized how important programming is in industry and graduate school. Traveling to Israel was a great decision that will impact me for years to come.<br>
  <br>
  I would like to thank the faculty at Tel Aviv University who collaborated to organize the program for us as well as professor Nehorai and especially our donor who gave us this wonderful gift.</p>

<p> Traveling to Israel with Washington University in St Louis was an outstanding experience in pretty much every way I can think of.<br>
  <br>
  In terms of education and exposure to my interests, this trip covered a huge amount in a very short amount of time. Although I had been to Israel once before, it hadn’t been from a technological point of view. Seeing so many diverse labs (electronic devices, neurobiology, nanotechnology, etc.) and companies showed me some of the real applications of my eventual degree. The work of both the students at Tel Aviv University (TAU) and the surrounding companies was really inspiring; I even got a few ideas for my senior design project. The robotic arm in the TAU robotics lab that responded to haptic feedback made me think about how a real Iron Man’s suit could mimic human motion in the future in a war or on a construction site. In the non-linear optics lab, I was reminded that, with science and engineering, the impossible is often achieved, as when the lab showed that certain particles go from one energy level to an unconnected 3rd  level, without going through the seemingly necessary 2nd level that bridges them.  The visit to PrimeSense makes me want to buy an Xbox Kinect. I don’t want to play the games, I just want to figure out how to view the internal different camera angles and functions and see what I can do with them.<br>
  <br>
  Being in the land of Israel for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot was another really great opportunity. It is one of the three Jewish pilgrimage holidays, so it was nice to be able to be there surrounded by millions of other Jews. In one of the labs I even got to see a Seder Plate that was one micron across carved out of silicon (wrong holiday but it was still very cool)!<br>
  <br>
  Socially, I was able to meet and become friends with a remarkable group of people. All of the Wash U students who attended have been in the same department as me for the past two years, yet I had never met or spoken to most of them. Because of this trip, I can now count every one of those very awesome people as my friend, and I look forward to spending the next year (or two) with those remaining at Wash U. Even though I was a little skeptical about meeting the Tel Aviv University students, they were exceptional as well, making us feel very welcome, and accepting us as friends instead of as an assignment forced upon them. I’m glad I will be able to keep in touch with many of those students too.<br>
  <br>
 Thank you so much to everyone that made such a great experience possible, especially Dr. Arye Nehorai, Elad Gilboa, and Professor Arie Yeredor for planning all of our activities and leading us through them, and the generous donor who funded a large portion of the trip. I feel happy and gratified that there is a Wash U program set up whereby students for years to come can be inspired by the technology and innovation of the beautiful state of Israel.</p>

<p> My experience in Israel can be broken down into three major categories of learning: technical, cultural, and social.<br>
  <br>
   For the technical aspect, we toured numerous engineering labs at Tel Aviv University including the nanotechnology center, the digital signal processing lab, the nonlinear optics lab, the aerodynamics lab, and the robotics lab. In these labs, we learned how the students and professors are are approaching and tackling some very interesting projects. What was even more enlightening than the specific solutions that the researchers had designed or were in the process of designing was learning about the process of how the research happens at each stage. The intermediate steps of the projects receive less attention than end results, but they make up the bulk of the time spent. The fairly in-depth tours we were given of the labs gave us the opportunity to explore the inner workings of the projects. This was especially intriguing to me because I am planning on going to grad school, and it offered a glimpse into that future.<br>
  <br>
 In addition to the engineering labs, we also visited several other research facilities such as the zoology garden where researchers collaborate heavily with the faculty of engineering. It showed us a glimpse at the potential breadth of our field. Outside of the university, we visited three companies—Motorola Mobility, Verint, and PrimeSense—that illustrated the working environments of large international tech companies and small tech start-ups. PrimeSense, the Israeli start-up that developed the 3D camera in the Microsoft Kinect, was especially of interest to me. Due in large part to that visit, I am currently working on a project using the Kinect to control a robotic arm.<br>
  <br>
  The cultural aspect can be divided further into traditional and modern parts. The bulk of my experience with the traditional culture of Israel came from our weekend tour, during which we explored Tel Aviv, Yafo, Jerusalem, Masada, and the Dead Sea. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and engaging, but he also allotted time for individual exploration of the areas. I experienced the modern culture of Israel, or more pointedly Tel Aviv, primarily through the day-to-day events like taking cabs around to the different companies, walking around Tel Aviv, and acquiring food. On the plane ride over, I taught myself to sound-out words in Hebrew with the help of the Israeli woman sitting next to me. Throughout the trip, I tested myself on signs, billboards, and menus. By the end of the trip, what had started out as an indecipherable set of characters became more accessible and precipitated much of my understanding of the modern culture in Tel Aviv.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, I got chance to learn about and experience the social aspects of Israeli culture and forge connections Tel Aviv University students. We first met most of them at an event called Student's Day where we talked and listened to music. As the week went on, we hung out frequently with them and got to discuss many of the finer points of our respective cultures. Being able to get to know them allowed us to make valuable connections that enable future collaborations in academic and business spheres. I also owe much of my appreciation for Israel's inner workings to Elad Gilboa, the doctoral student at WashU who attended the trip. As he is from Israel, he served as our primary liaison and made sure we got the most out of our daily excursions into the city.<br>
  <br>
  I am very grateful for being able to participate in this trip. I thank the donor without whom this trip would not have been possible, and I also thank Dr. Nehorai and the ESE Department for organizing the trip. I learned a great deal of things about electrical and systems engineering and about Israel.</p>
