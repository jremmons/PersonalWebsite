    In the past our group has shown that the ultrasound power backscattered from 
    subvolumes of <i>in vitro</i> tissue preparations is dependent on the 
    temperature of the tissue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
    backscattered power tends to monotonically increase or decrease depending on 
    the dominant type of scatterer within the subvolume.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>We have extended this research to an <i>in vivo</i> system to test 
    this hypothesis in living perfused tissue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The animal system consisted of nude mice with implanted tumors (HT29 
    colon cancer line) on their hind quarters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The mice were anesthetized with Ketamine Xylazine prior to being 
    secured to a platform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The platform 
    and lower section of the mouse were submerged in a temperature controlled 
    water bath filled with degassed water. The temperature of the mouse was 
    measured with an implanted thermistor in a contralateral limb which had a 
    similar implanted tumor and was similarly submerged in the water bath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The transducer from a commercial laptop-based ultrasound system (Terason 
    2000, Teratech Corporation) was coupled to the target tumor through the 
    water bath and images of the heated tumor were acquired at 0.5 </span><sup>

    </span>These data are being analyzed in a manner similar to that used for 
    data acquired from <i>in vitro</i> samples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>From these experiments we expect to learn the effects of perfusion 
    and other physiological effects on our measure of the temperature dependence 
    of backscattered ultrasound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus 
    far we have completed the experimental design and have run experiments on a 
    sacrificed mouse and on a living mouse. We will report on the suitability of 
    the experimental setup as well as analysis of the backscattered ultrasound.
