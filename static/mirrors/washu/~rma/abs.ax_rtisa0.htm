<p><font face="Arial">Pulse-echo image generation requires knowing the time of 
flight (TOF) for ultrasound in tissue. TOF depends on propagation distance and 
the speed of sound (SOS). Conventional imaging systems assume SOS in tissue is 
constant with a value close to that for water. Adaptively focusing under varying 
assumptions about SOS can improve pulse-echo images and elicit local values for 
SOS. Regions (64x64 mm) with varying SOS were simulated. Contrast of images of a 
point-like scatterer at 50 mm, formed using a 32-element, linear array of 1.1 x 
13 mm transducers, with center frequencies of 3.5 MHz, improved by 8-10 dB when 
actual SOS was taken into account. To implement an adaptive, synthetic-focus 
scheme, the variation of SOS and TOF in tissue must be modeled. We previously 
approximated TOF with integer-degree polynomials in range and azimuth to reduce 
image generation time for constant-SOS regions. Here the utility of these 
polynomials to describe regions with varying SOS was explored. Paths in an 
assumed SOS map with tissue-like variation, were matched to within 1.1% with a 
fourth-degree polynomial. If the coefficients of these polynomials can be 
estimated from measured backscattered signals via adaptive-focus imaging, then a 
polynomial description of SOS and TOF may lead to improved image quality along 
with SOS characterization in tissue.</font></p>
