<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">The use 
of an interrogating ultrasound beam for noninvasive measurement of temperature 
has been investigated from many perspectives.&nbsp; Our group is looking at how the 
backscattered energy from individual scatterers changes with temperature.&nbsp; By 
measuring the backscattered energy from a single ultrasound beam (A-mode) in a 
tissue sample while changing the tissue temperature we have gathered data from a 
minimum of 5 sites in several different tissue samples.&nbsp; We have performed 
experiments on bovine liver and turkey breast.&nbsp; Changes in backscattered energy 
appear to be consistent between the different types of tissue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically we 
have seen a change of between 5 and 15 dB in backscattered energy over the 
temperature range of 37 – 50<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; The energy may either increase or 
decrease with temperature depending on the type of scatterer that is being 
followed.&nbsp; To follow the behavior of the signal from individual scatterers we 
have segmented signals by hand.&nbsp; To automate the process we have segmented with 
matched filters and with arbitrary segment intervals.&nbsp; The performance of both 
methods was comparable to hand segmentation.&nbsp; The success of these automatic 
methods suggests that changes in backscattered signals with temperature can be 
tracked in real time over a variety of tissue types.</font></p>
