<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">The 
temperature dependence of the power received by an ultrasound transducer from 
the backscatter of an interrogating pulse is dependent on how certain ultrasonic 
tissue characteristics (speed of sound, attenuation and backscatter coefficient) 
change with temperature.&nbsp; A theoretical parametric analysis showed that the 
temperature dependence of the backscatter coefficient dominates the variation of 
the received power with temperature.&nbsp; According to this analysis the power 
received by the transducer could either increase or decrease depending on the 
type of tissue and the inhomogeneities within the tissue.&nbsp; We have confirmed 
this experimentally <i>in vitro</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; By capturing the RF signal from a single 
A-mode scan we have been able to identify individual scatterers and follow these 
scatterers as signals were obtained at temperatures from 37–50<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; 
The change in energy of these scatterers can increase or decrease with 
temperature and is for the most part monotonic.&nbsp; Typically we have seen a change 
of between 5 and 15 dB in backscattered energy over the temperature range of 
37–50<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; The envelope of a collection of scatterers can be used to 
infer the temperature of the tissue by analyzing the statistics of the 
collection.&nbsp; We found that the standard deviation of backscattered power 
increased monotonically with temperature and was accurately approximated by a 
second-order polynomial.&nbsp; Thus far we have segmented the individual scatterers 
by hand. <span style="color: red">&nbsp;</span>We are also working on utilizing 
automatic techniques such as matched filters and arbitrary segment intervals.</font></p>
