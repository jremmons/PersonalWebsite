<p align="justify">In contrast to the emphasis on shape structures that is characteristic of 
most image analysis research, we have emphasized the imaging physics in 
developing a model for representing ultrasonic images in terms of the underlying 
tissue shape. Ultrasound has been a major focus in image-guided surgery research 
for over a decade, but limited accuracy and ease-of-use issues remain 
prohibitive given current methodology. Toward a robust method for understanding 
as well as representing ultrasonic images, we have developed an image model 
framework that is based on a physical description of image formation. Our 
framework incorporates the gross surface shape, its scattering microstructure 
and the 3D point-spread function for the imaging system. The framework permits 
simulation of images, characterization of tissue via statistical images, and 
construction of a data likelihood for statistical inference of underlying model 
components. We have tested the model with cadaveric vertebrae by direct, 
registered comparison of simulated and actual images and by using the data 
likelihood to infer vertebral pose for registration. Because of its physical 
basis, the model could be adapted to account for other effects relevant to 
image-guided surgery such as attenuation- and speed-of-sound-based image 
distortion. As a framework, the physical description and image model are fully 
extendable to other applications, including adaptive image formation 
incorporating tissue shape.</p>
