<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="color: black">A noninvasive method for 
volumetrically determining temperature distribution during treatment would 
greatly enhance the ability to uniformly heat tumors at therapeutic levels.&nbsp; 
Ultrasound is an attractive modality for this purpose.&nbsp; We investigated changes 
in backscattered energy (CBE) with temperature from tissue inhomogeneities in 
the form of small (subwavelength) scatterers.&nbsp; Our predicted changes in 
backscattered energy were matched by <i>in vitro</i> measurements in bovine 
liver samples.&nbsp; We examined the results of studying CBE in tissue regions with 
multiple scatterers, of isolated individual scatterers, and in collections of 
individual scatterers.&nbsp; The latter appears to have the most potential.&nbsp; We 
measured the CBE from 37 to 50 <sup>o</sup>C with a focused circular transducer 
with a center frequency of 7.5 MHz.&nbsp; The standard deviation of the CBE of 120 
scatterers from 4 bovine liver samples increased nearly monotonically with 
temperature.&nbsp; The curve was well matched by a second-degree polynomial, which 
had a correlation coefficient of 0.998.&nbsp; The 120 scatterers came from 24 sites 
that were contained in a total insonified volume of less than 1 cm<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp; 
These results suggest our approach may be capable of 0.5 <sup>o</sup>C accuracy 
and 1 cm<sup>3</sup> resolution conveniently and at low cost.&nbsp; Because our 
approach exploits the inhomogeneities present in tissue, we believe that if it 
is successful <i>in vitro</i>, it holds promise for <i>in vivo</i> application.</span></p>
