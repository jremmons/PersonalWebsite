<p align="justify"><font COLOR="#000000" face="Arial">Automated
analysis of ultrasonic images could be greatly improved with model-based
Bayesian methods for image analysis.&nbsp;</font></FONT> <font COLOR="#000000" face="Arial">Such
an approach would require an accurate probabilistic image model representing
ultrasonic images in terms of the gross shape of underlying anatomical
structure. Existing probabilistic models for ultrasonic image data do not
adequately incorporate structure shape or system characteristics, thus a
substantially new approach is warranted.&nbsp; Toward that goal, we have
developed models for the imaging system and rough surface with the following
objectives:&nbsp; 1) accuracy in representation of basic image characteristics
such as the texture and intensity, 2) a minimum of computational requirements,
and 3) a form that is naturally</font> <font COLOR="#000000" face="Arial">extendable
to an appropriate probabilistic image model.&nbsp; The imaging system was
modeled as a linear system with a separable three-dimensional point-spread
function having an envelope of Gaussian curves in each dimension.&nbsp; The
rough surface was modeled as a collection of discrete scatterers placed on the
continuum and parametrized by a surface roughness and scatterer
concentration.&nbsp; Models were evaluated by a visual comparison of actual and
simulated images of a cadaveric lumbar vertebra.&nbsp; The gross shape of the
vertebral surface was estimated from computed tomography
images of the vertebra, and simulated images were generated using the models and
the gross surface shape.&nbsp; Actual images were registered with the surface
and simulated images to within 2 mm.&nbsp; The similarity of the actual and
simulated images was quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the
models.&nbsp; Differences between the images were less than that between two
simulated images separated by 0.4 mm, or one-fifth the registration error.&nbsp;
Further assessment of the models would require a statistical approach not yet
available.&nbsp;</font> <font COLOR="#000000" face="Arial">The
models do, however, provide the basis for the development of a computationally
tractable probabilistic image model for image analysis.&nbsp; Such a model will
provide the means for a statistical evaluation of the system and surface models.</font></p>
