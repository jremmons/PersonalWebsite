<P style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0" align="justify"><b>Purpose.</b>&nbsp; 
Myocardial disease is common in the diabetic, including elevated risk for 
myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Both diabetes 
and obesity, which is common among diabetics, are responsible for deleterious 
electrophysiological and geometric changes to the heart. Here we investigate the 
effects on body-surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) of changes in cardiac geometry 
associated with both diabetes and obesity. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 
has been found to occur among diabetic and obese groups. Additionally, heart 
position and orientation can change inside the obese torso. To quantify effects 
of these geometric changes, we modified the realistic heart and torso models of 
the simulation package ECGSIM (<a href="http://www.ecgsim.org/">http://www.ecgsim.org/</a>) 
[1] as input to our bidomain forward-problem solution.<br>
<b>Method &amp; Materials.</b>&nbsp; To simulate LVH effects, both the inter-ventricular 
septum (IVS) and the posterior wall (PW) of a normal heart model were increased 
5% (LVH5), and 20% (LVH20) for the diabetic and obese cases, respectively. 
Values were selected to match measured increases in the thickness of the IVS and 
PW of 2-9 and 1-8%, respectively, in diabetic patients [2]. In the obese group, 
IVS and PW increases of 11-22 and 13-25%, respectively, were seen [3]. To 
simulate the obese heart displacement, the heart was shifted (8% of the torso 
height) and rotated (6, 4.5 and 28 degrees in the coronal, frontal and sagittal 
planes). These values were taken from experimental measurements on normal and 
obese subjects made by our group. A bidomain forward-problem model was used to 
calculate ECGs from cardiac transmembrane potentials.<br>
<b>Results.</b>&nbsp; Three measures were employed to evaluate the effects of 
geometric changes on ECGs over the body surface during the QT interval: 1) the 
relative root mean square differences (RD), 2) the correlation coefficient (CC), 
and 3) the average change in ECG value. During the QT interval, the RD was 3, 11 
and 102 % for the LVH5, LVH20, and heart displacement cases, respectively. 
Corresponding CC values were 0.9998, 0.9974 and 0.5361. In the LVH5 and LVH20 
models the average ECG value was raised in the precordial region by 4.3% and 
16.9%, respectively, whereas heart displacement raised average ECG values by 
508% on front of the upper left torso and reduced them by 60% over the lower 
left torso.<br>
<b>Conclusions.</b>&nbsp; These results suggest that geometric changes accompanying 
diabetes and obesity may have a significant effect on ECG values compared to 
those expected for normal subjects. These effects demonstrate the limitations of 
using the standard 12-lead signals for diagnosing LVH in the presence of 
obesity, which often accompanies diabetes. The large error with heart 
displacement associated with obesity suggests the use of body-surface maps and 
inverse solutions on the heart-surface to get a comprehensive, stable measure of 
cardiac sources in obese subjects.</P>
