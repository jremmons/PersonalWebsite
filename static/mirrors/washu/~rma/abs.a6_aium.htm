<font face="Arial">Abstract</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ultrasound is an attractive modality for 
noninvasive temperature imaging to monitor hyperthermia treatment of cancer. 
Previously, we predicted monotonic changes in backscattered energy (CBE) of 
ultrasound with temperature for certain sub-wavelength scatterers then measured 
CBE with temperature in bovine liver, turkey breast, and pork muscle in 
agreement with our predictions. The objective of this study was to measure CBE 
in vivo to determine its suitability for temperature estimation in perfused, 
living systems.<br>
<br>
We measured CBE in living normal murine tissue and in implanted tumors (HT29 
colon cancer line) on nude-mouse preparations. Measurements were made in 
degassed water heated homogeneously. Four mice, one with an implanted tumor were 
anesthetized with Ketamine Xylazine and heated. Temperature was measured with a 
thermistor at the hind limb contralateral to the one imaged. Imaging was done 
with a Terason 2000 (Teratech Corp., Burlington, MA), laptop-based, phased-array 
system. The imaging system used a 7-MHz linear probe (model 10L5) focused at 2 
cm, the center of the mouse leg. Images were taken in 0.5oC steps from 37.0 to 
45.0oC. For image regions within each preparation, motion was tracked and 
compensated using cross-correlation of RF signals at adjacent temperatures. 
Envelopes of motion-compensated image regions were found with the Hilbert 
transform then smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter. Backscattered energy 
at each pixel was referred to the value at 37oC to find CBE.<br>
<br>
Motion estimates were typically 0.3 – 0.4 mm axially, the propagation direction 
of the transducer, and &lt; 0.1 mm in the lateral direction. In studies of 4 
motion-compensated regions from images of normal tissue and 3 motion-compensated 
regions of implanted tumor, CBE varied nearly monotonically by about 4 dB. CBE 
in tumor was similar to that in normal tissue. <br>
<br>
Our findings of the CBE dependence on temperature in living mice are consistent 
with both our theoretical predictions and our previous in vitro studies. These 
results support using CBE for temperature estimation in living systems.<br>
