<P><FONT face=Arial>Abstract</P>
<p align="justify">Hyperthermia has been used as a cancer treatment in which tumors are elevated 
to cytotoxic temperatures to aid in their control. A noninvasive method for 
volumetrically determining temperature distribution during treatment would 
greatly enhance the ability to uniformly heat tumors at therapeutic levels. 
Ultrasound is an attractive modality for this purpose. We investigated changes 
in backscattered energy (CBE) from pulsed ultrasound with temperature. Our 
predicted changes in backscattered energy were matched by <i>in vitro</i> 
measurements in samples of bovine liver, turkey breast, and pork rib muscle. We 
studied CBE in tissue regions with multiple scatterers, of isolated individual 
scatterers, and in collections of individual scatterers. The latter appears to 
have the most potential. We measured the CBE with a focused circular transducer 
with a center frequency of 7.5 MHz. The standard deviation of the CBE of 75-125 
scattering regions from 0.3 to 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> volumes increased nearly 
monotonically from 37 to 50 <sup>o</sup>C in each tissue type. Although the 
slopes were different, the curve for each type of tissue was well matched by a 
second-degree polynomial, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 in each case. 
Thus the use of the CBE of ultrasound for temperature estimation may have 
clinical promise with a convenient, low cost modality. Because our approach 
exploits the inhomogeneities present in tissue, we believe that if it is 
successful <i>in vitro</i>, it holds promise for <i>in vivo</i> application.</p>
