<P style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0" align="justify">Noninvasive temperature imaging would enhance the 
ability to uniformly heat tumors at therapeutic levels. Ultrasound is an 
attractive modality for this purpose. Previously, we predicted monotonic changes 
in backscattered energy (CBE) of ultrasound with temperature for certain 
sub-wavelength scatterers. We also measured CBE values similar to our 
predictions in bovine liver, turkey breast, and pork muscle in 1D. Those 
measurements were corrected manually for changes in the axial position of echo 
signals with temperature. To investigate the effect of temperature on CBE in 2D, 
we imaged 1-cm thick samples of bovine liver, turkey breast, and pork muscle 
during heating in a water bath. Images were formed by a Terason 2000 imager with 
a 7 MHz linear probe. Employing RF signals permitted the use of 
cross-correlation as a similarity measure for automatic tracking of feature 
displacement as a function of temperature. Feature displacement across the 
specimen was non-uniform with typical total displacements of 0.5 mm in both 
axial and lateral directions. Apparent movement in eight image regions in each 
specimen was tracked from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps. 
Envelopes of motion-compensated image regions were found with the Hilbert 
transform then smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter before forming the 
backscattered energy at each pixel. Our measure of CBE compared means of both 
the positive and negative changes in the BE images. CBE was monotonic and 
differed by about 4 dB at 50<sup>o</sup>C from its value at 37<sup>o</sup>C. 
Relatively noise-free CBE curves from tissue volumes of less than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> 
supports the use of CBE for temperature estimation.<br>
