<p class="MsoNormal">Abstract</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Previously, we have investigated techniques for 
measuring temperature-dependent change in backscattered energy (CBE) in 1D 
ultrasonic signals. Extension of those techniques to 2D images is limited by 
apparent non-rigid motion of tissue as temperature changes. Our recent 
experimental data comes from a Terason 2000 laptop-based ultrasound system 
equipped with a 7MHz linear array probe, model 10L5. Typical image sets cover 37 
to 50<sup>o</sup>C with 0.5<sup>o</sup>C&nbsp; steps, with apparent movement between 
0.5 and 1 mm laterally and axially. This movement was estimated by maximizing 
the cross-correlation of image regions at adjacent temperatures. After 
compensation for movement, image data was squared and averaged to form 
backscattered energy at each pixel. Two measures were computed to characterize 
the CBE over an image region, the standard deviation over the whole region and 
the means of all positive- and all negative-going pixels in the region. These 
results are consistent with theoretical expectations and continue support the 
possibility of using CBE in ultrasound as a tool for noninvasive thermometry.
