Ultrasound is an attractive modality for non-invasive temperature imaging to 
enhance the ability to target tumor heating at therapeutic levels. &nbsp;Previously, 
we predicted monotonic changes in ultrasonic backscattered energy (CBE) for 
certain sub-wavelength scatterers. &nbsp;Recent advances include: 1) measurement of 
CBE in 2D and in 3D <i>in vitro</i>, 2) measurement of CBE in 2D <i>in vivo</i>, 
3) simulation of CBE from multiple scatterers, and 4) estimation of temperature 
from CBE in simulated images.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Accurate measurement of CBE requires compensation for apparent motion of image 
features due changes in speed of sound. We measured CBE in 2D in 
motion-compensated images of four 1-cm thick samples of bovine liver, two of 
turkey breast, and one of pork muscle during uniform heating in a water bath 
from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C. &nbsp;Images were formed by a Terason 2000 imager with a 
7 MHz linear probe focused at 4.5 cm, the center of each tissue specimen. 
Employing RF signals from the Terason 2000 (courtesy Teratech Corp.) permitted 
the use of cross-correlation as a similarity measure for automatic feature 
tracking with temperature. &nbsp;Tissue motion in 8 image regions of each specimen 
was tracked from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps. &nbsp;Maximum 
displacement in all specimens was about 0.5 mm in both axial and lateral 
directions. &nbsp;Motion compensated image regions were demodulated and smoothed. 
&nbsp;Pixel values were squared to form the backscattered energy. &nbsp;We compared means 
of both the positive and negative changes in the BE images. &nbsp;CBE was monotonic.&nbsp; 
BE differed by about 4 dB at 50<sup>o</sup>C from its value at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We have conducted preliminary experiments in 3D by taking seven 2D images 
separated by 0.6 mm in elevation at each temperature.&nbsp; We applied our motion 
detection and correction methods to a region in the resulting 3D volume then 
made movies of slices in elevation.&nbsp; As expected the dominant motion was in the 
axial direction.&nbsp; The apparent motion encountered in elevation was much smaller 
than the beam width in elevation, so that the percentage of scatterers that move 
in or out of the beam in elevation is expected to be smaller than the percentage 
in the lateral direction. Motion within a wide beam will change the 
backscattered energy less than that in a narrow beam. Thus, we expect CBE to 
support temperature estimation in 3D.</font></p>

Theoretical results for a single scatterer showed that backscattered energy 
increases or decreases monotonically, depending on the lipid or aqueous nature 
of the scatterer. &nbsp;To extend our theory to a more realistic tissue composition, 
we have developed methods for simulating ultrasonic images of thousands of 
randomly distributed scatterers. &nbsp;In the simulations, the imaging system was 
described by its point-spread function, and the tissue medium was represented by 
discrete aqueous and lipid scatterers. &nbsp;Images were simulated to represent 
temperatures from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C by changing the scatterer amplitudes 
according to curves predicted previously for single scatterers. &nbsp;CBE was 
computed for each image pixel, referenced to the initial image. To characterize 
CBE for a region, the means of the positive- and negative-changing pixels and 
the standard deviation of all pixels were computed. &nbsp;CBE showed the same 
monotonic increase and decrease as in experimental results and covered ranges 
similar to both prediction and experiment. Subsequent simulations included 
additive noise and showed striking agreement with experimental CBE measurements, 
replicating both an initial jump and noise throughout the range. These results 
support the use of CBE for noninvasive temperature estimation, showing that our 
model for the temperature dependence of CBE can be successfully applied to 
measurements from multiple scatterers.&nbsp; These simulation methods also provide a 
means for exploring limits on temperature accuracy and spatial resolution with 
varying imaging systems and tissue types. They could also be useful in studying 
the effects of apparent and bulk tissue motion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As an example of methods that could be used for calibration and estimation, we 
have extended our image simulation methods to the initial development of 
calibration curves and use of those curves for estimating temperature from CBE. 
&nbsp;Calibration curves were generated by fitting the average CBE from multiple 
simulations with a polynomial.&nbsp; This polynomial represents the average standard 
deviation of the CBE for images of a simulated population of lipid and aqueous 
scatterers with added noise. Estimates of temperature were then generated from 
that same population using the calibration curve.&nbsp; Results showed an error of 
approximately ± 1<sup>o</sup>C for these images of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> or 
approximately 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup> (based on a 3 mm elevation ultrasonic beam 
width).&nbsp; This error for a small volume with typical measurement noise levels 
suggests 0.5<sup>o</sup>C or better accuracy may be attainable in 1 cm<sup>3</sup> 
volumes with noise reduction techniques.</font></p>
