<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultrasound is an attractive 
modality for non-invasive temperature imaging to enhance the ability to target 
tumor heating at therapeutic levels.&nbsp; Previously, we measured monotonic changes 
in ultrasonic backscattered energy (CBE) <i>in vitro </i>in 2D and in 3D that 
matched changes we predicted for certain sub-wavelength scatterers.&nbsp; Here we 
consider: 1) measurement of CBE in 2D <i>in vivo</i>, 2) simulation of CBE from 
multiple scatterers, and 3) estimation of temperature from CBE in simulated 
images.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We measured CBE in living 
normal murine tissue and in implanted tumors (HT29 colon cancer line) on 
nude-mouse preparations.&nbsp; Measurements were made in degassed water heated 
homogeneously.&nbsp; Four mice, one with an implanted tumor, were anesthetized with 
Ketamine Xylazine and heated.&nbsp; Temperature was measured with a thermistor at the 
hind limb contralateral to the one imaged.&nbsp; Imaging was done with a Terason 2000 
(Teratech Corp., Burlington, MA), laptop-based, phased-array system.&nbsp; The 
imaging system used a 7-MHz linear probe (model 10L5) focused at 2 cm, the 
center of the mouse leg.&nbsp; Images were taken in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps from 37.0 
to 45.0<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; For image regions within each preparation, non-rigid 
motion compensation was applied using cross-correlation of RF signals at 
adjacent temperatures.&nbsp; Envelopes of motion-compensated image regions were found 
with the Hilbert transform then smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter. 
Backscattered energy at each pixel was referred to the value at 37<sup>o</sup>C 
to find CBE.&nbsp; CBE was nearly monotonic with temperature.&nbsp; BE differed by 5-6 dB 
at 45<sup>o</sup>C from its value at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theoretical results for a 
single scatterer showed that backscattered energy increased or decreased 
monotonically, depending on the lipid or aqueous nature of the scatterer.&nbsp; To 
extend our theory to a more realistic tissue composition, we have developed 
methods for simulating ultrasonic images of thousands of randomly distributed 
scatterers.&nbsp; In the simulations, the imaging system was described by its 
point-spread function.&nbsp; The tissue medium was represented by discrete aqueous 
and lipid scatterers.&nbsp; Images were simulated to represent temperatures from 37 
to 50<sup>o</sup>C by changing the scatterer amplitudes according to curves 
predicted previously for single scatterers.&nbsp; CBE was computed for each image 
pixel, referenced to the initial image. To characterize CBE for a region, the 
means of the positive- and negative-changing pixels and the standard deviation 
of all pixels were computed.&nbsp; CBE showed the same monotonic increase and 
decrease as in experimental results and covered ranges similar to both 
prediction and experiment. Subsequent simulations included additive noise and 
showed striking agreement with experimental CBE measurements, replicating both 
an initial jump and noise throughout the range. These results support the use of 
CBE for noninvasive temperature estimation, showing that our model for the 
temperature dependence of CBE can be successfully applied to measurements from 
multiple scatterers.&nbsp; These simulation methods also provide a means for 
exploring limits on temperature accuracy and spatial resolution with varying 
imaging systems and tissue types. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an example of methods 
that could be used for calibration and estimation, we have extended our image 
simulation methods to the initial development of calibration curves and use of 
those curves for estimating temperature from CBE.&nbsp; Calibration curves were 
generated by fitting the average CBE from multiple simulations with a 
polynomial.&nbsp; This polynomial represents the average standard deviation of the 
CBE for images of a simulated population of lipid and aqueous scatterers with 
added noise. Estimates of temperature were then generated from that same 
population using the calibration curve.&nbsp; Results showed an error of 
approximately ± 1<sup>o</sup>C for these images of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> or 
approximately 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup> (based on a 3 mm elevation ultrasonic beam 
width).&nbsp; This error for a small volume with typical measurement noise levels 
suggests 0.5<sup>o</sup>C or better accuracy may be attainable in 1 cm<sup>3</sup> 
volumes with noise reduction techniques.</span></p>
