<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ultrasound scattered from a 
volume of tissue depends on tissue properties, such as attenuation, velocity, 
density, and backscatter coefficient and on the characteristics of the 
transducer at the insonified volume. We modeled the backscattered signal to 
determine how its energy varied in response to a change in temperature.&nbsp; 
Temperature dependence of backscattered energy was dominated by the effect of 
temperature on the backscatter coefficient.&nbsp; This behavior was seen for both 
aqueous and lipid-based scatterers in a water-based medium.&nbsp; Temperature 
dependence of the backscatter coefficient was inferred assuming that the 
backscatter coefficient was proportional to the scattering cross section of a 
small (subwavelength) scatterer.&nbsp; In our model backscattered energy increased 
nearly logarithmically with temperature over the range from 37o to 50o C.&nbsp; Our 
model predicted a change of +5 dB for the lipid scatterer and a change of up to 
-3 dB for the aqueous-based scatterer over that temperature range. Our 
experimental results in bovine liver showed that backscattered energy change was 
similar to that predicted.&nbsp; Total backscattered energy at 7.5 MHz, along a 1.5 
cm paths from 19 sites in three specimens, changed by as much as +4 or -3 dB 
over the range from 37 to 45 <sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; Energy of individual scatterers 
along those paths changed monotonically with temperature by as much as </font>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">±</font></span><font face="Arial"><font size="3">7 
dB.&nbsp; </font><span style="color: black"><font size="3">Because our approach 
exploits the inhomogeneities present in tissue, for situations in which 
temperature dependence of the backscattered energy can be calibrated, it may be 
possible to use the backscattered energy levels to track temperature 
distributions in tissue volumes.</font></span></font></p>
