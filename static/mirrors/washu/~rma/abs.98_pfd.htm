<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial">The finite difference element method (FDM)
provides a straightforward and easy way to construct and solve</font> <font face="Arial">accurate,
patient-tailored models of the human thorax as a volume conductor. However, the
usability of the method is decreased by computationally slow iterative method to
solve the source-field problem. In this work we present a method to implement
FDM thorax model into a MASPAR massively parallel array processor.&nbsp; FDM
elements are based on a rectangular grid that is</font> <font face="Arial">used
throughout the volume. This grid was mapped directly into the parallel
processing array in such a way that each processor acts as a computational
element. The stack of elements at a particular FDM grid position in all slices
were loaded into the memory of a processor at the same grid point in the
processor array. Thus the iterative process was</font> <font face="Arial">mapped
from the single-element mode of the conventional computers into a single-slice
mode. Each slice can have 16000 elements, which are solved simultaneously,
decreasing the calculation time accordingly.&nbsp; The array processor will be
used to obtain solutions for a very accurate thorax model featuring the anatomy
of the Visible Human Man.</font></p>
