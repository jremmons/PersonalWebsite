<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>Background.</b>&nbsp; 
Ultrasound is an attractive choice for noninvasive thermometry to enhance tumor 
treatment using hyperthermia.&nbsp; Our theoretical model [1] predicted and 
in-vitro experiments [2] verified that the change in backscattered ultrasonic 
energy (CBE) is monotonic (approximately 0.2~0.3dB/oC) with temperature in the 
hyperthermia range, motivating the usage of CBE for ultrasonic thermometry.&nbsp; 
One limitation in measuring temperature-dependent CBE from ultrasound images is 
apparent motion in the images due to change of the speed of sound and motion of 
the tissue.&nbsp; Previously, a block-matching motion-tracking method was used 
to compensate rigid motion, but was only successful for small regions [2]. <br>
<b>Methods.</b>&nbsp; We have developed an algorithm for estimating and 
compensating non-rigid motion over large 2D or 3D regions.&nbsp; The motion 
field was modeled to vary linearly over the region of interest and was estimated 
by maximizing the cross-correlation between the reference and subsequent images 
using optimization functions in MATLAB®.&nbsp; Factors affecting performance of 
the algorithm were studied using simulation of images for multiple scatterers 
[3]. Images before and after motion were simulated by transforming scatterer 
locations. <br>
<b>Results.</b>&nbsp; Our algorithm was successfully applied to images from 
in-vitro and in-vivo heating experiments, with significant improvement in 
performance over previous results based on qualitative assessment.&nbsp; To 
study the performance quantitatively, 2D images were simulated with various 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and types and ranges of motion, including expansion 
and compression to study image decorrelation.&nbsp; CBE due to motion was 
different between axial and lateral directions and was about 2.5dB/0.1mm 
translation and 1dB per ±1% expansion axially and 4.5dB/mm and 0.35dB per ±1% 
laterally.&nbsp; Error in motion estimation decreased with SNR with minimal 
impact on CBE and increased with decorrelation leading to 0.1~0.2dB additional 
CBE.&nbsp; In addition to inducing estimation error and thus CBE, decorrelation 
itself caused erroneous CBE as much as 0.3~0.4 dB for 6% lateral compression and 
1% axial compression.<br>
<b>Conclusions.</b>&nbsp; CBE induced by motion critically limits temperature 
imaging and thus necessitates accurate motion estimation and compensation.&nbsp; 
Our current algorithm works effectively with motion studied in simulation and 
encountered in heating experiments.&nbsp; Future work will include incorporation 
of nonlinear motion field, estimation of motion in the presence of 
temperature-dependent CBE, reducing effects of decorrelation, and motion 
compensation on temperature imaging during clinical hyperthermia.<br>
