<font face="Arial">Abstract</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultrasound is an 
attractive modality for noninvasive temperature imaging to monitor temperature 
changes during hyperthermia.&nbsp; Previously, we predicted monotonic changes in 
backscattered energy (CBE) versus temperature for certain sub-wavelength 
scatterers.&nbsp; We then measured CBE with temperature in bovine liver, turkey 
breast, and pork muscle and found these measurements to be in agreement with our 
predictions.&nbsp; The objective of this study was to measure the CBE and to 
determine its suitability for temperature estimation in perfused, living 
systems.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We measured CBE in 
living normal murine tissue and in implanted tumors (HT29 colon carcinoma) in 
nude-mouse preparations.&nbsp; Measurements were made in degassed water heated 
homogeneously with the mouse partially submerged in the water. &nbsp;The hind limb of 
the mouse was imaged with the ultrasound imaging system.&nbsp; A thermistor was 
placed near the contralateral limb to track the temperature of the tissue.&nbsp; The 
imaging system was a Terason 2000 (Teratech Corp., Burlingon, MA) laptop-based, 
phased-array system.&nbsp; The imaging system used a 7-MHz linear array transducer 
with the focus set at 2 cm, the center of the mouse limb.&nbsp; For the homogeneous 
heating images were taken in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps from 37 to 45<sup> o</sup>C.&nbsp; 
For images within each preparation, motion was tracked and compensated using 
cross-correlation of the RF signal at each temperature.&nbsp; Envelopes of 
motion-compensated image regions were found with the Hilbert transform and 
smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter.&nbsp; Backscattered energy at each pixel 
was referred to the energy at 37 <sup>o</sup>C to find the CBE.&nbsp; Experiments 
were also performed using a small animal heating ultrasound system (SAHUS) as a 
heterogeneous heat source. For heterogeneous heating, the mouse was placed in 
the SAHUS and the images were attained orthogonal to the heating apparatus 
through ultrasound coupling gel.&nbsp; Images were taken before heating, during 
heating at different power levels and in rapid sequence after heating.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion estimates were 
typically 0.3 – 0.4 mm axially and 0.1 mm in the lateral direction for the 
homogeneous heating.&nbsp; In studies of motion-compensated regions from images of 
normal tissue and in regions of implanted tumor, CBE varied nearly monotonically 
by about 4dB and the change in tumor tissue was similar to that in normal 
tissue.&nbsp; The images during heterogeneous heating were contaminated by the 
ultrasonic radiation from the heat source.&nbsp; Analysis of the images before 
heating and the rapid sequence after heating (during cool down) is ongoing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our findings of the 
CBE dependence on temperature in living mice are consistent with our previous 
theoretical predictions and our previous <i>in vitro</i> studies.&nbsp; These results 
support using CBE for temperature measurements in living systems.</font></p>
