Ultrasound is an attractive modality</font></span><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3"> 
for monitoring temperature during heating of tumors to therapeutic levels.<span style="color:black">
</span>Previously, we <span style="color:black">predicted monotonic changes in 
ultrasonic backscattered energy (CBE) for certain sub-wavelength scatterers. 
Accurate measurement of CBE requires compensation for apparent motion of image 
features. We measured CBE in 2D in motion-compensated images of four 1-cm thick 
samples of bovine liver, two of turkey breast, and one of pork muscle during 
heating in a water bath from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C. Images were formed by a 
Terason 2000 imager with a 7 MHz linear probe focused at 4.5 cm, the center of 
each tissue specimen. </span>Employing RF signals from the Terason 2000 
(courtesy Teratech Corp.) permitted the use of cross-correlation as a similarity 
measure for automatic feature tracking with temperature. Tissue motion in 8 
image regions of each specimen was tracked from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C 
steps. Maximum displacement in all specimens was about 0.5 mm in both axial and 
lateral directions. Motion compensated image regions were demodulated and 
smoothed. Pixel values were squared to form the backscattered energy. We 
compared means of both the positive and negative changes in the BE images. CBE 
was monotonic.&nbsp; BE differed by about 4 dB at 50<sup>o</sup>C from its value at 
37<sup>o</sup>C. We measured motion in 3D in one sample of turkey breast by 
taking 7 images at each temperature displaced by 0.6 mm in elevation.&nbsp; We plan 
to extend our 2D methods to 3D motion compensation, but because beam width in 
elevation was 2.5 mm, five times the maximum apparent motion in 2D, effects of 
apparent motion in elevation on CBE may be negligible. Relatively noise-free CBE 
curves from tissue volumes of less than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> supports the use of CBE 
for temperature estimation.</font></span></p>
