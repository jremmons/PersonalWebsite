<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Direct inference of heart-surface from body-surface 
potentials has been the goal of most recent work on electrocardiographic inverse 
solutions. We developed and tested indirect methods for inferring heart-surface 
potentials based on estimation of regularized multipole sources. Regularization 
was done using Tikhonov, constrained-least-squares, and multipole-truncation 
techniques. These multipole-equivalent methods (MEM) were compared to the 
conventional mixed boundary-value method (BVM) in a realistic torso model with 
up to 20% noise added to body-surface potentials and ±1 cm error in heart 
position and size. Optimal regularization was used for all inverse solutions. 
The relative error of inferred heart-surface potentials of the MEM was 
significantly less (p &lt; 0.05) than that of the BVM using zero-order Tikhonov 
regularization in 10 of the 12 cases tested. These improvements occurred with a 
fourth-degree (24 coefficients) or smaller multipole moment. From these 
multipole coefficients, heart-surface potentials can be found at an unlimited 
number of heart-surface locations. Our indirect methods for estimating 
heart-surface potentials based on multipole inference appear to offer 
significant improvement over the conventional direct approach.</font></p>
