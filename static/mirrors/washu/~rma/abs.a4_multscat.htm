<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Theoretical and experimental 
evidence continues to suggest that backscattered ultrasonic energy changes 
predictably with temperature. Previously, theoretical results for a single 
scatterer showed that backscattered energy increases or decreases monotonically, 
depending on the lipid or aqueous nature of the scatterer. Recent experimental 
results showed that the same trend holds for measurements over an image region 
subtending multiple scatterers. To extend our theory to a more realistic tissue 
composition, we have developed methods for simulating ultrasonic images of 
multiple randomly distributed scatterers. In the simulations, the imaging system 
was described by its point-spread function, and the tissue medium was 
represented by discrete aqueous and lipid scatterers. Images were simulated to 
represent temperatures from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C by changing the scatterer 
amplitudes according to curves predicted previously for single scatterers. 
Change in backscattered energy (CBE) was computed for each image pixel, 
referenced to the initial image. To characterize CBE for a region, the means of 
the positive- and negative-changing pixels and the standard deviation of all 
pixels were computed. The region CBE showed the same monotonic increase and 
decrease as in experimental results and covered ranges similar to both 
prediction and experiment. Subsequent simulations included additive noise and 
showed striking agreement with experimental CBE measurements, replicating both 
an initial jump and noise throughout the range. These results support the use of 
CBE for noninvasive temperature estimation, showing that our model for the 
temperature dependence of CBE can be successfully applied to measurements from 
multiple scatterers. &nbsp;These simulation methods also provide a means for 
exploring limits on temperature accuracy and spatial resolution with varying 
imaging systems and tissue types. </font></p>
