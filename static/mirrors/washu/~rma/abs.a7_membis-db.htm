<b>Purpose. </b>&nbsp;The combination of hyperthermia with conventional 
chemotherapy or radiation has proven to be beneficial in the treatment of 
cancer.&nbsp; A major limitation for hyperthermia currently is the absence of 
adequate information about the temperature distribution in soft tissue to guide 
thermal dosimetry.&nbsp; We predicted a monotonic change in ultrasound 
backscattered energy using lipid and aqueous sub-wavelength scatterers [1]. <i>
In-vitro</i> experiments with porcine and turkey tissue verified this 
prediction.&nbsp; Studies by others have indicated that the echo pattern in 
ultrasonic images is determined largely by the content, configuration, and 
distribution of collagen.&nbsp; To better understand the phenomena that cause 
changes in backscattered energy (CBE), we have 1) refined our theoretical model 
to include collagen and 2) examined the relationship between CBE and tissue 
structure in both simulated and measured images.<br>
<b>Methods.</b>&nbsp; CBE images were formed from simulated B-mode images [2]. 
Simulated images were based on random distributions of populations of aqueous, 
lipid and collagen scatterers in an aqueous medium.&nbsp; Measured CBE was found 
from ultrasonic images of turkey breast in a water bath during heating from 37<sup>o</sup>C 
to 50<sup>o</sup>C in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps. Images were obtained with a 
Terason 2000 system (Teratech Corp., Burlington, MA) using a 7.5 MHz linear 
probe by placing the transducer both parallel and perpendicular to the turkey 
muscle fibers.&nbsp; For both simulated and measured images, CBE images were 
calculated from the squared envelopes of the B-mode images.&nbsp; CBE images 
were compared to their respective B-mode images.</font></p>

<b>Results. </b>&nbsp;Correlation coefficients from CBE based on simulated 
images showed significant correlation between the CBE and the B-mode images.&nbsp; 
Simulated images used random placement of scatterers and therefore does not show 
any specific structure.&nbsp; For the experimental results, there was a weak 
correlation (r = 0.2-0.34) for both alignments of the transducer with respect to 
the fiber direction of the turkey muscle.&nbsp; Correlation was also found from 
regions of bright echo (r =0.39 and 0.36 for parallel and perpendicular 
orientations, respectively), but was strongest for regions with pure speckle 
texture (r = 0.8 and 0.65, respectively).<br>
<b>Conclusion. </b>&nbsp;Examination of the statistical correlation between CBE 
images and their respective B-mode images indicates strong correlation between 
speckle texture and CBE.&nbsp; The effect, however, of tissue constituents and 
structure on CBE is not clear.&nbsp; Further investigation of this phenomenon is 
being done by comparing histological studies with CBE images to correlate fiber 
structure with the change in backscattered energy.<br>
