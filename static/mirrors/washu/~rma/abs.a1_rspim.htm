<p align="justify">Despite significant efforts towards various applications of ultrasound-based 
tissue registration, ultrasound still plays a minor role in clinical 
computer-assisted intervention. Interpretation of the images is one major 
obstacle. Towards a robust and accurate approach to automated interpretation, we 
have developed a probabilistic model representing ultrasonic images in terms of 
surface shape. The model is derived from a physical description of image 
formation that incorporates the shape and microstructure of tissue and 
characteristics of the imaging system. A framework for inference of surface 
shape is formed by constructing a data likelihood from the probabilistic model. 
We have used this likelihood with a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm to 
estimate the pose of a vertebra from a set of three simulated images. In 20 
trials, the estimate error was less than 0.2 mm and 0.4 degrees in 15 trials and 
over 1.0 degrees in only 1 trial. While much work remains to develop clinical 
utility in any application, these results indicate significant potential for the 
approach.</p>
