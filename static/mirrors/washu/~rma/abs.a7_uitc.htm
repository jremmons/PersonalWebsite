<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Ultrasound is an 
attractive modality for non-invasive temperature imaging to enhance the ability 
to target tumor heating at therapeutic levels.<br>
Previously, we measured monotonic changes in ultrasonic backscattered energy (CBE) 
in vitro in 2D and in 3D for multiple porcine, bovine and turkey tissues and in 
vivo in living normal murine tissue with implanted tumors (HT29 colon cancer 
line) on nude-mouse preparations. Measured changes were consistent with 
predictions for certain sub-wavelength scatterers and with results from 
simulations for images of populations of temperature-dependent scatterers. 
Application of temperature imaging to monitoring of tumor heating requires 
accurate temperature estimation over small volumes, e.g., to within 0.5<sup>o</sup>C 
for tissue volumes of 1cm<sup>3</sup>, requiring consistent and predictable 
measurements of the temperature dependence of CBE. Using simulation studies, we 
have studied the impact of various factors on the variation of measurable CBE 
with temperature. In these simulations, we represented the imaging system by its 
point-spread function and the tissue medium by discrete scatterers with a 
variable range of temperature dependence. Images were simulated to represent 
temperatures from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C by changing the scatterer amplitudes 
according to curves predicted previously for single scatterers, and CBE was 
computed for regions based on the means and standard deviation for CBE over all 
pixels in the region. CBE computed from simulation showed the same monotonic 
increase and decrease as in experimental results and covered ranges similar to 
both prediction and experiment. We used multiple simulations to characterize 
temperature-dependent CBE statistically and found that the region size, type and 
distribution of scatterers in a population, and image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
all had a significant impact, i.e., each could change the mean and/or standard 
deviation of the temperature-dependent CBE by 0.5-1dB resulting in potential 
temperature estimation errors of 1-2<sup>o</sup>C. With a consistent scatterer 
population and image SNR, however, a region size equivalent to a 1cm3 tissue 
volume produced estimation error less than 0.5<sup>o</sup>C. We are currently 
conducting 3D in vitro heating experiments with turkey tissue to apply these 
simulation findings to experimental measurements and investigate temperature 
accuracy and spatial resolution. 2D images are acquired with a Terason 3000 (Teratech 
Corp., Burlington, MA), laptop-based, phased-array system using a 7-MHz linear 
probe (model 12L5). 3D images are generated by translating the probe in the 
elevation dimension using a stepper motor system and are acquired at 
temperatures from 37.0 to 50.0<sup>o</sup>C in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps. Apparent 
motion in the images is compensated using a 3D non-rigid motion-compensation 
algorithm. The 3D motion field is approximated as varying linearly over the 
tissue volume and is estimated by maximizing the 3D normalized cross-correlation 
using standard optimization techniques available in Matlab®. Initial CBE 
measurements are consistent with previous results. We expect that by using a 
consistent region size and accounting for SNR, CBE can be calibrated in this 
tissue to provide estimation of temperature to 0.5<sup>o</sup>C for a 1cm<sup>3</sup> 
volume.</span></p>
