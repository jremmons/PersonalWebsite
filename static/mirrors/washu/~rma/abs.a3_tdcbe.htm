<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Noninvasive temperature 
imaging would enhance the ability to uniformly heat tumors at therapeutic 
levels. <span style="color: black">Ultrasound is an attractive modality for this 
purpose. </span>Previously, we <span style="color: black">predicted monotonic 
changes in ultrasonic backscattered energy (CBE) for certain sub wavelength 
scatterers. We measured CBE values similar to our predictions in bovine liver, 
turkey breast, and pork rib. Those 1D measurements were corrected manually for 
changes in the axial position of scatterers with temperature. To investigate the 
effects of apparent motion on CBE in 2D, we imaged 1-cm thick samples of beef 
liver during heating in a water bath from 37 to 50<sup>o</sup>C. Images were 
formed by a Terason 2000 imager with a 7 MHz linear probe focused at 4.5 cm, the 
center of the tissue specimen. </span>Employing RF signals from the Terason 2000 
(courtesy Teratech Corp.) permitted the use of cross-correlation as a similarity 
measure for automatic tracking of feature displacement as a function of 
temperature. Tissue motion across the specimen was non-uniform with typical 
total displacements of 0.5 to 1mm in both axial and lateral directions. Tissue 
motion in image regions of about 15 mm<sup>2</sup> was tracked from 39 to 50<sup>o</sup>C 
in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps. Motion compensated image regions were demodulated 
with the Hilbert transform and smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter. 
Values were squared to form the backscattered energy at each pixel. Our measure 
of CBE compared standard deviations of the BE images. CBE increased 
monotonically to about 4 dB at 50<sup>o</sup>C from its value at 39<sup>o</sup>C. 
The CBE curve was matched by a second degree polynomial with &#961; &gt; 0.99. 
Relatively noise-free CBE curves from tissue volumes of less than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> 
supports the use of CBE for temperature estimation. Motion in 3D will affect CBE 
values, but that motion can tracked as it was in this study. Because beam width 
in elevation is larger than the lateral width, effects of motion in elevation on 
CBE may be less. Thus, we expect CBE to support temperature estimation in 3D.</font></span></p>
