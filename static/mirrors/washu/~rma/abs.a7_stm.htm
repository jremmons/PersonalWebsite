<font face="Arial">Abstract</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Background:</i> We have previously 
shown that the change in backscattered ultrasound energy (CBE) from heated 
tissue tracks with temperature and shows promise for utilization as a method for 
non-invasively monitoring thermal therapies. The heating methodology we have 
used until now, however, has been water baths that allow uniform heating of in 
vitro or in vivo tissues. This set up is not clinically relevant as patients are 
heated with local devices that induce considerable temperature heterogeneity.
<br>
<i>Methods:</i> In order to move to a more realistic heating set up we have 
looked into coupling CBE measuring devices (Terason 3000, Teratech Corp.) with 
clinically relevant devices that produce heterogeneous heating: the Small Animal 
Heating Ultrasound System (SAHUS) and a clinical ultrasound heating system, the 
Sonotherm 1000 (Labthermics Technologies, Inc.). The coupling of the CBE 
measurement device to tissue samples or patients is complicated by maintaining a 
water path between tissue, the measurement device and the heating device. Also, 
ultrasound from the heating devices causes interference in the CBE measurement 
data. This noise must be filtered from data in order to analyze CBE during 
heating.<br>
<i>Results:</i> Using either orthogonal or oblique angles between the direction 
of the interrogating ultrasound beam for CBE measurement and the ultrasound beam 
used for heating we have been able to image and analyze data measured during the 
heating of tissue in living mice (SAHUS) and a human (Sontherm 1000). 
Interference from the heating ultrasound can be partially filtered from CBE data 
to reduce noise from stray ultrasound. Interference was reduced by 50 dB from RF 
CBE data collected while heating with the Sonotherm, a device which produces 
continuous square waves. Data collected from narrow band continuous wave 
sinusoidal devices such as the SAHUS should be easier to filter and analyze. 
Measurements and analysis with the Sonotherm and SAHUS on tissue samples will be 
presented.<br>
<i>Conclusions:</i> This work is a significant step towards experimentation 
which will further the measurement of CBE in clinically relevant heating 
scenarios. <br>
