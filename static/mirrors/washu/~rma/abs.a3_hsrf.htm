for Using Ultrasound to Generate a Heart Surface for Electrocardiographic 
Inverse Problems",

<p ALIGN="justify">Errors of electrocardiographic inverse solutions are especially 
sensitive to the accuracy with which a heart model is constructed and placed 
within the torso. In an effort to reduce those errors, we have improved our 
previous methods for generating individualized heart models from ultrasound 
images. An ultrasound probe is tracked using an Immersion digitizer, allowing 
measurement of the orientation and position of each image. Images are tracked 
relative to the torso, which is also measured using the digitizer. The probe is 
calibrated by imaging a phantom consisting of multiple N-fiducials and computing 
a transformation between ultrasound coordinates and Immersion measurements. 
Using these methods, we have constructed a heart surface model from apical and 
parasternal images acquired at multiple rotations and tilts with a Terason 2000 
imaging system. Accuracy of the methods is limited by multiple factors, 
including patient movement, tracking error, and image analysis. We plan to 
investigate these limitations and to extend these methods to model dynamic, 
time-varying heart shape and location. Such studies are critical for the 
development of individualized anatomies, which are crucial for continued 
advancement of inverse methods.</p>
