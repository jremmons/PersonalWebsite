<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ultrasound is an attractive modality for 
non-invasive imaging to monitor temperature of tumorous regions undergoing 
hyperthermia therapy. Previously, we predicted monotonic changes in 
backscattered energy (CBE) of ultrasound with temperature for certain 
sub-wavelength scatterers. We also measured CBE values similar to our 
predictions in bovine liver, turkey breast muscle, and pork rib muscle in both 
1D and 2D in in vitro studies. To corroborate those results in perfused, living 
tissue, we measured CBE in both normal tissue and in implanted human tumors 
(HT29 colon cancer line) in 7 nude mice. Images were formed by a phased-array 
imager with a 7.5 MHz linear probe during homogeneous heating from 37 to 45<sup>o</sup>C 
in 0.5<sup>o</sup>C steps and from body temperature to 43<sup>o</sup>C during 
heterogeneous heating. We used cross-correlation as a similarity measure in RF 
signals to automatically track feature displacement as a function of 
temperature. Feature displacement was non-uniform with a maximum value of 1mm 
across all specimens during homogeneous heating, and 0.2 mm during heterogeneous 
heating. Envelopes of image regions, compensated for non-rigid motion, were 
found with the Hilbert transform then smoothed with a 3x3 running average filter 
before forming the backscattered energy at each pixel. Means of both the 
positive and negative changes in the BE images were evaluated. CBE was monotonic 
and accumulated to 4–5 dB during homogeneous heating to 45<sup>o</sup>C and 3–4 
dB during heterogenous heating to 43<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; These results are 
consistent with our previous in vitro measurements and support the use of CBE 
for temperature estimation in vivo during hyperthermia.</font></p>
