the full-body surface to a torso model in forward and inverse 
electrocardiography&quot;, International Journal of Bioelectromagnetism, vol. 5, pp. 
312-313, 2003.</p>
<p ALIGN="justify">Accuracy of inferred heart potentials is limited by errors in 
the geometry of the torso model. To quantify effects of torso-model 
construction, we segmented images of the Visible Human Male to create full-body, 
torso- and heart-model surfaces. All body surfaces contained the same 163 
electrode sites. Relative errors of forward-problem solutions compared to the 
full-body results at the electrodes were 0.024, 0.026, and 0.027 for models with 
cumulative removal of arms and legs, head and pelvis, and shoulders, 
respectively. Relative errors of inverse solutions near the peak of the QRS 
complex with 1% noise in body-surface potentials increased from 0.34 for the 
full body, to 0.40, 0.42, and 0.42 in the reduced-surface models. Results 
suggest that removal of arms and legs is the most critical step in model 
construction and that surface reduction may increase relative errors of inverse 
solutions by about 20%.</p>
