<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ultrasound is an attractive modality for temperature 
monitoring because it is nonionizing, convenient, inexpensive, and has 
relatively simple signal processing requirements. This modality may be useful 
for temperature estimation if a temperature-dependent ultrasonic parameter can 
be identified, measured, and calibrated. The most prominent methods for using 
ultrasound as a noninvasive thermometer exploit either 1) echo shifts due to 
changes in tissue thermal expansion and speed of sound (SOS), 2) variation in 
the attenuation coefficient, or 3) change in backscattered energy from tissue 
inhomogeneities. The use of echo shifts has received the most attention in the 
last decade. By tracking scattering volumes and measuring the time shift of 
received echoes, investigators have been able to predict the temperature from a 
region of interest both theoretically and experimentally in phantoms, in 
isolated tissue regions <i>in vitro</i>, and preliminary <i>in vivo</i> studies. 
A limitation of this method for general temperature monitoring is that prior 
knowledge of both SOS and thermal-expansion coefficients is necessary. Acoustic 
attenuation is dependent on temperature, but with significant changes occurring 
only at temperatures above 50<sup>o</sup>C, which may lead to its use in thermal 
ablation therapies. Minimal change in attenuation, however, below this 
temperature range reduces its attractiveness for use in clinical hyperthermia. 
Models and measurements of the change in backscattered energy suggest that, over 
the clinical hyperthermia temperature range, changes in backscattered energy are 
dependent on the properties of individual scatterers or scattering regions. 
Calibration of the backscattered energy from different tissue regions is an 
important goal of this approach. All methods must be able to cope with motion of 
the image features on which temperature estimates are based. A crucial step in 
identifying a viable ultrasonic approach to temperature estimation is its 
performance during&nbsp;<i>in vivo</i> tests.</font></p>
