<p ALIGN="justify">Reduction of sudden death requires accurate identi.cation of 
patients at risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and effective therapies. The 
Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial and Multicenter Automatic 
Defibrillator Implantation Trials demonstrate that the implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator impacts favorably on the incidence of VT in patients with 
myocardial infarction, underscoring the need to detect the electrophysiologic 
abnormalities required for the development of VT. Methods used for this purpose 
include: Holter monitoring, ejection fraction, signal-averaged ECG, heart rate 
variability, T-wave alternans, baroreflex sensitivity, and programmed 
stimulation. Performance of each method alone has demonstrated high negative, 
but low-positive predictive values. Recent studies confirm that their use in 
combination augments performance. A second approach for improving performance 
has been to reexamine how well each method detects the electrophysiological 
derangements that lead to VT. Our recent work has focused on the signal-averaged 
ECG. Judging from transmural maps of ventricular activation during VT and sinus 
rhythm obtained from patients, late potentials fail to detect completely signals 
from myocardium responsible for VT. To obviate this limitation we developed an 
approach based on inferred epicardial potentials in the frequency domain from 
190-surface ECGs using individualized heart-torso models. Torso geometry and 
electrode positions are measured with a 3-armed digitizer. The location of 
cardiac structures is determined using echocardiography. The pericardial surface 
is approximated by a sphere that encloses the heart. Epicardial potentials are 
inferred using the boundary element method with zero-order Tikhonov 
regularization and the Composite Residual Smoothing Operator over the QRS 
complex. Studies are underway to determine if analysis of bioelectrical signals 
enveloping arrhythmogenic tissue improves identification of patients vulnerable 
to VT.</p>
