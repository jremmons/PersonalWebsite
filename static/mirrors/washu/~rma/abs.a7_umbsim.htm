<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ultrasound backscattered from tissue has previously been 
shown theoretically and experimentally to change predictably with temperature in 
the hyperthermia range, i.e., 37 to 45<sup>o</sup>C, motivating use of the 
change in backscattered ultrasonic energy (CBE) for ultrasonic thermometry. Our 
earlier theoretical model predicts that CBE from an individual scatterer will be 
monotonic with temperature, with, e.g., positive change for lipid-based 
scatterers and negative for aqueous-based scatterers. Experimental results have 
previously confirmed the presence of these positive and negative changes in 
one-dimensional ultrasonic signals and in two-dimensional images acquired from 
<i>in vitro</i> bovine, porcine and turkey tissues. In order to investigate CBE 
for populations of scatterers, we have recently developed an ultrasonic image 
simulation model, including temperature dependence for individual scatterers 
based on predictions from our theoretical model. CBE computed from images 
simulated for populations of randomly distributed scatterers behaves similarly 
to experimental results, with monotonic variation for individual pixel 
measurements and for image regions. Effects on CBE of scatterer type and 
distribution, size of the image region, and signal-to-noise ratio have been 
examined. This model also provides the basis for future work regarding 
significant issues relevant to temperature imaging based on ultrasonic CBE such 
as effects of motion on CBE, limitations of motion-compensation techniques, and 
accuracy of temperature estimation, including tradeoffs between temperature 
accuracy and available spatial resolution.</font></p>
