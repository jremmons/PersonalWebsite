<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">State-of-the-art approaches to shape analysis in medical 
images use a variety of sophisticated models for object shape.&nbsp; We have developed 
an image model that permits the application of these approaches to ultrasonic 
images, with detailed methods for representing rough surfaces.&nbsp; Our image model 
is probabilistic and based on a physical model for image formation that 
incorporates the system point-spread function (PSF), the tissue microstructure 
and the gross tissue shape.&nbsp; At each image pixel, the amplitude mean and variance 
is computed, characterizing the combined influence of shape, microstructure and 
system PSF.&nbsp; Calculation of the SNR<sub>0</sub> permits further classification of 
each pixel as Rayleigh- or non-Rayleigh-distributed.&nbsp; This characterization was 
used here to generate a Rayleigh/Gaussian data likelihood for any set of image 
data, conditioned on surface shape and pose. Maximum likelihood pose estimation 
was performed using derivative-based optimization algorithms for images of a 
cadaveric vertebra.&nbsp; Successful results were achieved in the simulation 
environment for a data set of only three images.&nbsp; With a quasi-Newton BFGS 
algorithm, error in 15 of 20 trials was less than 0.4 degrees in rotation and 
0.2 mm in translation.&nbsp; Estimation was inaccurate in only 1 of 20 trials.&nbsp; These 
results illustrate the potential of the model and the approach and serve as an 
example of quantitative assessment of the model via performance in a specific 
application. </font></p>
