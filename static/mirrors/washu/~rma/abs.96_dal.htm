<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000" face="Arial">Aimed-lead potentials on the
heart in a concentric-spheres model, found as a weighted sum of the terms in a
multipole inverse solution, were compared to those found using the
boundary-element method. Relative errors were comparable when optimal
regularization was used. The aimed-lead method was applied to the multipole
inverse for a normal adult male obtained from 190 leads using an individualized
torso model. As expected, the aimed-lead epicardial maps showed higher spatial
frequencies than those seen on the body surface.</font></p>
